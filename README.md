# Task Box :notebook:

This is a multiplatform desktop task application. To create it I made use of Electron in order to allow me to create the application using HTML and CSS achieving a responsive and pleasant design easily. For the management of the MongoDB database I made use of ExpressJS in the backend and it communicates with AngularJS to manage the views, that is, I made use of the MEAN stack. Since it is an application designed for me, it can not be used by any user since the application requires that you have a MongoDB database.


## Dev

```
$ npm install
```

### Run

```
$ npm start
```

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

Builds the app for macOS, Linux, and Windows, using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).
